The battery charge been terminated on the battery beam Roger. We see you, Jack and uh we got a reading of uh minus two degrees in the docking uh index. We'd like to know if that's all precise or if it's 2.1 or 1.9 but it's minus 2.0 precisely. Thank you. Ok. We've got one more item for you. When you get a chance, we'd like it to uh stir up your cryo tanks. In addition, I have a shaft and Tron for a look at the common Bennett if you need it standby. Ok. Yeah, not a problem here. Can say again, please. All right, here's the menopause may be both article rather man be interval stand by 13. We're looking at it. Ok. Uh Right now, uh you sent me uh voltages. Uh It's looking good though. We had a pretty large bang associated with the uh caution and warning there. And as I recall, BB was the one that had a spike on it once before endocrine the over here, uh we're starts to go ahead and button up the tunnel again. Yeah. Yeah, that, that jolt, uh, must have rocked the, uh, the sensor on, uh, see now on 02 quantity two, it's uh, was oscillating down around 20 to 60%. Now it's full scale high again. And, uh Houston, we had to restart on our computer. We had things light and, uh, and the restart, reset right here, We restart and restart on the pain. And I'm looking at this super special. Uh You have what we have uh B as B and B is B pool. You have two do but Paul and uh secondary propellants, I have A and uh CP pole P mag temperatures. Ok. AC two is showing zip and trying to reconfigure on that. Jack. Sure. We got a uh the main buffet under vote now too, Sean Maine under vote. You about 25.5. I mean bee's reading zip right now. Uh He was just uh out of play one, Jim. Ok. Houston, we'd like you to attempt to reconnect fuel cell one to Main A and Fuel cell three to Main B verify that quad delta is open. Ok. Uh Houston, I'm showing uh I tried to reset and the field. No one and three are both showing gray flags, but they both on zip on the clothes. Ok. Ok. Houston, are you still in 13? That's affirmative. Uh We're reading you. We're uh trying to come up with some good ideas here for you. Ok, let me give you some reading gay in the interim to help uh Main A uh go Jack. I've got the bus on. Say again, Fred. Yeah, I'm gonna help out main A voltage. I've got the main bus. I uh bad ac on uh I would rather accept the uh 25 volts that we're seeing on Main A. Ok. But I ac N Dean Houston, we need Arm and Charlie, please. Ok. In Houston, uh we'd like you to verify a couple of readings for us. Uh We'd like the nitrogen pressure on fuel cell one. We need the oxygen pressure and fuel cell too. Ok. Nitrogen on one and oxygen on two. Is that correct? Negative oxygen on three? Ok. Ok. So test one A set Z and uh two Baker which is uh three oxygen uh says 0.6 two, Baker is 0.6 and uh say again the other one. Uh fuel cell one nitrogen uh reads uh zero. Roger zero. Ok. In Houston, we'd like you to open circuit fuel cell one, leave two and three as is ok. I'll get to work on that and uh Jack uh our 02 quantity number two tank is look at that 02. Quantity number two is zero. That's easy. Ok. Yeah, that's, that's a good thing to see. And I wish to me looking at the uh hatch that we are bending something. We are, uh, we are venting something out, uh, into the, uh, into space. Rather we copy your vending. So the guys of some sort. Ok. Fuel Cell one. You just wanted to off the line. Now, Jack, is that right? We just wanted you to open the one. She's also the one, a lot of control of Houston. Um, this rapid exchange of conversation you've heard. Uh May the main B bus uh is off the line of fuel cells, one and three, also off the line. Uh Fuel cell two is presently on the line. We now show 13 at an altitude of 178,643 nautical miles, 56 hours, 12 minutes into the flight. Dan Houston. Uh We see you getting close to Gimble there. We'd like you to, uh, bring up all squad C's on main A quad C one C two, C three C four on main A and also bring B three and B four up on main A Dan Haren. You read? Oh, we got it. Ok. Ok. Can you tell us anything about the venting, uh, where it's coming from? Uh, what, when do you see it at coming out of window one right now? Jack. And uh, could you give me the thrusters again? Ok. The thruster. What, what? Uh but we like, uh on May A, we'd like Charlie 123 and four also bravo three and four on May 8. Ok. Got it. Reference there is to the reaction control system thrusters. We're at 56 hours, 14 minutes now into the flight dean. We need, I'm Ne Bravo Harney Bubble. Ok. 13. This is Houston. Uh, we'd like you to, uh, go to your GNC checklist, the pink pages, uh, 1-5 to, uh, power down until we get a delta of 10 amps over. All right, Roger. Well, control Houston. Um, that last report from, uh, Lasma asked the, ah, 13 crew to reduce electrical load on the, the spacecraft. Ok. Uh We'd like you to, uh, go down that power down procedure until you get delta of 10 amps over that your thing. Ok. Oh, Control Houston. Uh, we, uh, you copy our uh power down request. All right, Jack, we uh, yeah, we right now, where did you say that was located? Jack, that's in your uh systems checklist. Page 1-5. Low control Houston. Uh, we repeat again that I'd also check for those pages in your uh launch checklist. There are emergency pages pink pages, 1-5. And, uh, we'd like you to get the check check. Roger, uh, power down until you get an average of 10 amps less than what you got now. Ok. Or control of Houston. Ah, we repeat again that, ah, main bus B on the command and service module is now off the line. They're functioning in bus, a fuel cells. One and three are connected uh with bus B are now off the line. Ok. Uh Jack, are you happy with the uh apps we have now stand by one, Fred. Ok, Jack. And on this uh page 1-5 we proceeded right down the list all the way down. Where right now at the mag number two, is it warm up? Roger? We copied B bag two and warm up with all you through? Ok. And, uh, something is, uh, giving us the rates jack both in pitch and roll. I suspect that maybe it's whatever it is it's sending back there. I've had to use direct in order to stabilize this. And as soon as I do, we're starting to pick up rates again. Can you pick up any Jip, sorry, stand by reduction. Are your rates in jack negative tips and negative role right here in Houston. Uh, we need to get some more, uh, instrumentation up. We'd like you to put burger one on both AC buses over. Ok. You got the one on, uh, both AC buses now. But, uh, uh, one of the items that we turned off was the all the PSL pumps. Ok. And you might, uh, let us know, uh, when fuel cell too needs it pop back, we got to take care of that guy. Roger. Ok, Fred. We want the fuel cell two pumps. The AC one, please. You do the AC 100. Ok. It's on AC one. Um and Charlie, please. 13, I'll meet Telly. Ok. 13. Uh we've got lots and lots of people working on this. We'll get you some uh as soon as we have it and you'll be the first one to know. Thank you. Ok, Jack. And the weird configuration we're sitting in now is we have the hatch installed. We still have the proven drug inside the command by all. We're gonna stay in this situation until you kind of give us an OK, to reinstall a proven drove or if that is ready to use the lamp. Syllable. Yeah. And we'd like to have you put uh thruster alpha three on mayonnaise, please. Al Apria Mayo. Hey, Jack. Uh Are you monitoring the quad temps and the quad A back stamps affirmative dean. This is Houston. We'd like to power down just a little bit more. So let's get B mag two off and uh make sure your lights are down over. Ok. The lights are down. I be back two down. You know B mag is part of the uh S CS system on the uh Apollo command module. Of course, we're still attached to the learner module. So this is less of a crucial item to power down at this time. We're at uh 56 hours, 34 minutes into the flight continuing to monitor this as Apollo Control. Houston, can you something like you do at a fuel cell free? So it feels healthy. Go ahead. Jack G fuel cell three is uh off the 13 Houston. We'd like you to uh turn all your bravo thrusters off and put all your delta thrusters on May A please? What delta clusters are, May and all bravo clusters are 13 Houston turning battery. That's why we were pulling. You have enough. I, I don't have any time. It's off, it's off. They fix the bus completely now. No, 13 Houston. We'd like you to isolate your 02 surge tank over put span off now, Jeff. Ok. Jack. Are you copying the, I think one person that's affirmative and uh we're trying to get the power to that tank standby. We're working on it. Ok? We had a uh D like Jack. Mine is R CS B. Ok? No problem. Let's read to the lights we got on now. Trial press fuel cell one, fuel cell three made best B interval the person we copy them and we'd like to build up the pressure in 02 tank one. So turn the heaters on manually. We'll watch the pressure for you. Enjoy the uh we're gonna get a main buffet and a bowl. Probably Roger. Uh We realize that uh we feel was I have more amps on it. Ok. They are here. Ok? In Houston. Uh we'd like you to additionally bring on the fans in 02 tank one and uh we can stand the additional amperage on it. Ok. Bring up the fans see in Houston, we'd like you to check some circuit breakers on panel 226 two heater, number one Manna and check the three Cryo Fan motors tank. 13 phases. Ok. Jack 226 is configured uh just like it should be. I got uh three react breakers and pre rad breakers open. All the rest are closing. Hey, Fred. Thank you. But Jack looking outside, the number of particles has diminished greatly almost now, in the case, maybe what Manning has almost done, Jack, thank you. We copy. I'm still getting subs and N and tips though. Roger and uh 13, we'd like to verify that both B mags are off, please. Negative. We just have one BB C bag number one is still on. Ok, Jack, let's take B mag one off. No. Ok. Ok. This is Houston. We'd like you to give us a uh survey of uh your displays on uh MD C's uh one and two. give us a gauge readings and talk back over. Ok. We'll start with the display. The one. Yeah, check on M PC one or stuff. I have no all the rate indicator for zero. Number two, I uh uh main D I've got appears to be working normally right now. I'm sitting at zero pitch 180 y'all about 13 degrees. What a price 180 0. Ok. Uh The center panel, I'm looking at uh the R CS indicator a we have a Chinese temperature of about 180. Our head pressure is 3900. I'm looking at uh feel pressure of about quantity and percentage of about so it's 5%. She is about the San. Thank you. The pleasure of 190. I see. We're looking about the same except that the temperature is 100 I don't know, five days looking at a temperature of 160. Although in about the same you have pressure, pressure is looking nominal. You have pressure and package temperature is about uh little less than 80 on R one and about the same. Honoring. Yeah. Remote control Houston, I've got one gray. You have to all gray to the secretary of Paul and uh a gray. See by the pole D gray you got a hiccup ready there. It was great. Other, he's just primary in the okay, Jack Dutton at the time. The Cryo, thanks. Each two. One is reading uh 230 the same for two. Our 02 cryo tank one is uh looks like it's barely hold on its own at uh 300 KP two is reading zip. Uh quantities of H 21 is reading uh 73 to 74 on the 02 side. Uh We're reading uh 021 quantity 76 uh to, to uh back for he t Yeah. Inlet Marine. About 55 red out is a maybe about uh 30 and uh secondary outlet uh is reading uh bo control 52 degrees and the F out 1045 steam pressure 0.17 and like all discharge for eight super compressor is reading uh zip, the cube is uh reading uh 30 waist is reading about 34 portable free in about 98. And there a red uh inlet is leading about uh 71 and the uh read out to about 30 uh Glycol uh temp is reading uh 65 steam pressure peg four scale high discharge pressure uh nine P si excuse me, Fred, they'd like to butt in here a minute. We'd like to have uh thrusters see one off and uh proceed. Uh My last uh copy is uh secondary red in, OK. Your secondary uh rat in I gave the 7072 degrees. The rat out is about 30. Yeah, Michael of that Tim is reading about 65 steam pressure, full scale high I call discharge pressure about nine at P si the cube. Uh secondary accumulator is about uh 30 34% temperatures uh suits uh show on about uh 52 degrees, about 58 degrees. Sure. The third reading 4.1 cabinet five partial pressure CO2 is up to a little over one, about 1.1 on the SPF uh side of the house. The temperature is uh 72 degrees L 3d 3500 into a is reading 2300 into B about 2450 all pressures. Fuel is reading about 165 oxidizer 170. The fuel cells. We want those closers. I get P five degrees that your exhaust is a lower scale DLL uh two. Right now, we got an 02. our needs to uh flow reading of uh 0.13 to 0.14 and the 02 flow is right now pegged uh full scale high, Although it's been very uh dependent on thruster activity, which is also given its main buffet under volts uh from a steady reading about uh 1.1 up to full scale high. The FP scan is about uh 445 and the condenser exhaust uh 17 correction 180. Let's see uh if you want it on the uh DC indicator. Uh field cell one is uh zero amps two is reading uh somewhere between 44 and about uh oscillating 44 to 48. Again, depending on test directive and Marie is uh zero lamps say that again J or controlled Houston continuing to troubleshoot with the Apollo 13 crew. Closely watching oxygen quantities and pressures in the command module isolating the search tank leaves uh oxygen for entry if this should become necessary. So if necessary, the 13 crew could open the tunnel and use oxygen from the lunar module. A poll of 1300. OK. 13, this is Houston. It appears to us that we're losing 02 flow through uh fuel cell three. So, uh, we want you to close the react valve on fuel cell three. It looks like fuel cell one and two are trying to hold up. Ok. You coming, you're saying uh Fuel cell one and two and one and two are trying to hold up, but uh, we're leaking 02 on a fuel cell three. And you want me to uh, shut the react uh valve on fuel cell three. Did I hear you right? Primitive. Close the react valve on fuel cell three. Ok. I'll, I'll go to the SSR page. Uh You want me to go through that whole smash for uh fuel cell shutdown. Is that correct? Stand by? Well, uh 13 now, 180,098 nautical miles from earth velocity. Now rating 3200 and 19 ft per second. We at the 56 hours, 58 minutes known of the flight. Ok. 13. Uh We want you to uh turn the in line heaters off on fuel cell one. We want you to go through the fuel cell shutdown procedure on fuel cell 33 back. Ok. Shut down the headline heater on CC ONE. We're proceeding with the shutdown special fever team for the hotel tree. That's affirmative. Ok, Dean, I'm me Bravo. Please see Houston or uh go ahead. Ok. Uh You got on your bravo and uh we'd like to have you verify that the tape recorder is off, please. Uh That's very fine. Ok, Jack. Uh I'm sitting here with an 06 18 showing. I can't get rid of it. Uh Stand by just to. Ok. Fuel cell tree reacts are off on you, Roger Jim. Thank you our control. Houston speaking from the spacecraft for most of that conversation has been module pilot Fred Hayes. We're at 57 hours one minute now of the flight. Ok. Check step two special 17, 1 appeal procedure has been completed. Roger. Thank you. Hey, Jack, I'd like to bring on jet A four. I've got uh no negative uh pitch control, uh negative pitch control. And uh right now in either direct uh auto, OK? You say no pitch in either direct or auto you wanna bring on a four but I got a I got a positive pitch right? And I can't stop it. Ok? Ok, Jack ring a four on uh stop your picture. Ok, I got it. 13, we need me Charlie, please. Uh Bitter and uh Freda, we'd like to have you verify fuel cell reactants. Uh Talk back as Barbara Fold. Uh That's why I watched it. Then it went. Boba Pole was a through the switch Roger flight controllers. I'm handing over to Glenn. I assume the majority of other team guys uh pretty much briefed and up to speed as best we can. Now what I suggest is the white team do two things. They go over the D logs. Hey, Jack, let me give you a thruster configuration right now. A 131 A two or off Charley two main A all the pressure that I call it be a Baker one off dog one on Baker two off dog two on April 3, Charlie 3 April four Charlie four on Baker three off dog three on Baker four off dog four on. Ok, Jack. Uh, that th rest of configuration. Um, that's ok. All right. Ok. Do you want some rating from, uh, the system test be regarding fuel cells? Uh I want to Jack, uh, let me ask incompatibility 13. Uh We'd like to have you give us a system test readings on fuel cell one and three, please. Ok. One and three coming up. Ok. Ah, Jack, uh one A is reading uh, on lower scale. Zero B is reading uh 3.45. Ok. The only one cells 1 to 3. Ok. Ignore that one B reading. Uh, one C is reading, uh, 3.4. One D is really 2.4. It be is, uh, reading uh 0.25. Is that two Bravo? Fred two bravo is reading uh about 0.25 to 0.3. Ok, let me get back with you in a minute. Like with ST Boone readout, this is Apollo Control Houston 57 hours. 11 minutes 4.1. We now show an altitude of 180,521 nautical miles here in mission control. We're looking, uh, now looking towards an alternate mission swinging around the moon and using the lunar module power systems because of the situation that has developed here this evening, we now show a velocity of 3210 ft per second. This is Apollo Control. Houston. Why? Right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Wow. Later. Mhm. They all what I need. Yeah. Ok. Mhm. Hello, child. Mhm. Hi. Mhm. Right. F.\"\"\"\n",
